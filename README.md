# 📘 《On Java Learning》 Project

This repository is a collection of example code and test cases written while reading the book **"On Java (ver.2022)" + "Graphical Design Patterns"**, aimed at reinforcing concepts and providing a practical reference for future review or for others who are also learning from the book.

## ✨ Features

1. **📦 Chapter-Based Structure**  
   Each chapter of the book corresponds to a dedicated package in the repository. This structure ensures that the code is well-organized and directly tied to the specific topics covered in each section.

2. **💻 Code Examples and Test Cases**  
   The repository contains a variety of examples and test cases that demonstrate key concepts, allowing for hands-on exploration and better understanding of the material.

3. **📚 Learning and Reference**  
   This project serves as a study companion for myself and a reference for others learning "On Java." It is designed to make revisiting concepts or sharing knowledge with others more convenient.

## 🎯 Purpose

- 🛠️ To solidify my understanding of concepts by writing and testing code while reading the book.  
- 🔄 To create a structured and reusable resource for future review.  
- 🤝 To assist others who are also learning "On Java" by providing practical examples and clear organization.

## 🚀 Get Started

Feel free to explore the repository and use it as a supplementary resource for your learning journey! Whether you're revisiting concepts or starting fresh, this project is here to guide you.  

Happy coding! 🎉
